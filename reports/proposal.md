# Capstone project ideas

## 1. Open source project repositories

* Datasets:
  + Library.io datasets
  + Auxiliary resources (e.g., Google Trends)


* Who cares?
  + Anyone making decisions about investing in a software technology, independent developers


* Task and Questions: 
  + Correlate frequency of version updates, dependences, size, and overall language trends with longevity. Can we use the 'structural' data as a predictor of popularity (Google trends etc.). Developer salaries, ...
  + Can we identify categories of libraries and their common features and fate?
  + Find libraries with similar functionality within and between languages. Which one is the most likely to survive.
  + Any other resources for software statistics?
  + Are there any commonalities between the structure of library dependences and other characteristics in different languages? Can trends observed in one be translated to another?
  + What are the differences between the repositories?


## 2. Crowd funding

* Datasets: 
  + webroots.io/projects - Kickstarter and Indiegogo datasets


* Who cares? 
  + Both funders and startups


* Tasks and Questions:
  + What are the characteristics of funded projects?
  + Can we predict a successful delivery?
  + Predicting delays.
  + Explain reasons for the outcomes.


                                                                                          
## 3. U.S. electrical energy statistics

* Datasets 
 + www.eia.gov


* Who cares? 
  + Power plants, utilities, companies with high electricity use, solar companies


* Questions to answer
  + New electric grid capacity needed in near future?
  + Does it make sense to invest in solar?


## 4. Oil industry

* Datasets
    + Offshore drilling, Rig counts, Oil concessions, Pipelines
